## CS3307

The main objective of this project is to create a easy to use web service that interfaces with the Philips Hue lighting system, enabling users to access the various features of the platform that allows control over lighting in their homes through any connected web browser.  Through this web service, users can interact with their lights in their home by turning the lights on and off, adjust their brightness and set the color of a light.

This project utilizes a bridge emulator from https://github.com/SteveyO/Hue-Emulator as we did not have access to a Philips Hue system (i.e. A Bridge + Hue Light Bulbs).
